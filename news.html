        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
        Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.<br>
        Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.<br>
        Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.<br>
        Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.<br>
        Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.<br>
        Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
        Stay home if you feel unwell.<br>
        If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. <br>Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. <br>This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.<br>
        Masks
        Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others.<br> Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. <br>Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.<br>If symptoms peersisit seek medical care.
